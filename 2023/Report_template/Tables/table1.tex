Depletion & Depletion describes the level of reduction in the fish stock since fishing first began, typically by comparing current spawning biomass to that which would occur if there was no fishing (SB$_{current}$/SB$_{F=0}$). \\ \\
   Fishing mortality rate & The proportion of the stock removed by fishing in a unit of time. \\ \\
  Growth overfished & Fish are harvested at an average size that is smaller than the size that would produce the maximum yield per recruit. \\ \\
   Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) & The maximum amount of catch that can be taken from the stock per year, on average, in the long-term \\ \\
  Overfished fishery  & Occurs when there are no longer enough adults in the population to produce enough young to replace those fish removed from the population by fishing.  In the WCPFC, an overfished fishery is defined as one where the current spawning biomass (SB$_{current}$) is less than 20\% of the spawning biomass in the absence of fishing (SB$_{F=0}$).  \\ \\
   Overfishing  & In the WCPFC, overfishing is defined as occurring when the current fishing mortality rate exceeds the fishing mortality rate that would provide the maximum sustainable yield. Sustained overfishing leads to an overfished state. \\ \\
  Recruitment overfished & Occurs when the adult population is depleted to a level where it no longer has the reproductive capacity to replenish itself. \\ \\
