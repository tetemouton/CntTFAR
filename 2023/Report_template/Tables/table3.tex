  \hline
\hline
Species/Stock & Status & Last assessment & SC Recommendation & Reference \\ 
  \hline
Blue marlin & 2021 &  No overfishing, not overfished & need for improved biological data for all billfish species withinthe WCPFC convention areal & (SC19-SA-WP-16, WCPFC20-2023-SC19-01) \\ \\

Striped marlin (SWPO) & The stock is fully exploited, is not experiencing overfishing but is overfished & need for improved biological data for all billfish species withinthe WCPFC convention areal & 2019 & (SC19-SA-IP-11,WCPFC20-2023-SC19-01) \\ \\
  
North Pacific Swordfish & 2023 & No overfishing, not overfished; NP SWO stock status is positive with no evidence of excess F above FMSY or substantial depletion of spawning potential & (WCPFC20-2023-SC19-01, SA_WP_16_rev_1) \\ \\

Swordfish (SPO) & 2021 & SWPO stock - No overfishing, not overfished; develop sex disaggregated models to account for the
significant differences in life history between the sexes  and relatively simple single region spatial structure represent key areas of uncertainty in the assessment. & SA_WP_16_rev_1 \\ \\

Southwest Pacific Blue shark & 2022 & No overfishing, not overfished & Catch and fishing effort on blue shark should be carefully monitored & (SC17-SA-WP03; SC17-SA-IP-06;SC17-SA-IP-19) \\ \\
  
North Pacific Blue shark (NP) & 2022 & No overfishing, not overfished & Catch and fishing effort on blue shark should be carefully monitored & (SC18-SA-WP-06,SC19-EB-WP-06) \\ \\

Oceanic whitetip shark & 2019 & Overfishing, overfished & Management measures to reduce fishing mortality and to rebuild spawning biomass required and mitigation to avoid capture is recommended. & (SC19-EB-WP-06) \\ \\
  
Silky shark & 2023 & Overfishing, however is not overfished & Develop mitigation as well as measures control targeted catch. & (SC19-EB-WP-06) \\ \\
