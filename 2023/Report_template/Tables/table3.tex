Species/Stock & Assesed & Status & SC Recommendation & Reference \\ \hline
Blue marlin & 2021 &  No overfishing, not overfished & Need for improved biological data for all billfish species withinthe WCPFC convention areal & (SC19-SA-WP-16, WCPFC20-2023-SC19-01) \\ \hline
Striped marlin (SWPO) & 2019 & Stock fully exploited, not experiencing overfishing but is overfished & Need for improved biological data for all billfish species withinthe WCPFC convention areal & (SC19-SA-IP-11, WCPFC20-2023-SC19-01) \\ \hline
North Pacific Swordfish & 2023 & No overfishing, not overfished & NP SWO stock status is positive with no evidence of excess F above FMSY or substantial depletion of spawning potential & (WCPFC20-2023-SC19-01, SA-WP-16-rev-1) \\ \hline
Swordfish (SPO) & 2021 & SWPO stock - No overfishing, not overfished & Develop sex disaggregated models to account for the significant differences in life history between the sexes  and relatively simple single region spatial structure represent key areas of uncertainty in the assessment. & (SA-WP-16-rev-1) \\ \hline
Southwest Pacific Blue shark & 2022 & No overfishing, not overfished & Catch and fishing effort on blue shark should be carefully monitored & (SC17-SA-WP03; SC17-SA-IP-06, SC17-SA-IP-19) \\ \hline
North Pacific Blue shark (NP) & 2022 & No overfishing, not overfished & Catch and fishing effort on blue shark should be carefully monitored & (SC18-SA-WP-06, SC19-EB-WP-06) \\ \hline
Oceanic whitetip shark & 2019 & Overfishing, overfished & Management measures to reduce fishing mortality and to rebuild spawning biomass required and mitigation to avoid capture is recommended. & (SC19-EB-WP-06) \\ \hline
Silky shark & 2023 & Overfishing occurring, however not overfished & Develop mitigation as well as measures control targeted catch. & (SC19-EB-WP-06) \\ \hline
